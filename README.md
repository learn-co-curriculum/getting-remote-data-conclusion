# Getting Data from Remote Sources Conclusion

We've established how you can build classes and object that perform various
functions in an application, however, sometimes we want to incorporate remote
data into our applications. We've seen demonstrated that many applications give
us access to data via APIs.

APIs give us selective access to which parts of the that codebase the developers
want to expose. This can make it easier to work with. We should now understand
how APIs can be used, how to find API endpoint, and how to send a request for
data to an API.

With the ability to leverage remote data in our applications, we can increase
the functionality of our applications or even save time!
